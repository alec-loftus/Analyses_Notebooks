# various_notebooks
Repository is full of various notebooks used in projects. Some notebooks and scripts are available elsewhere as part of publications or research for the Kekenes-Huskey lab. These here are not for reproduction at this point in time. Packages include pandas, pyrosetta, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and Biopython (and maybe a couple others).
